# SOLVED - Uber Supply-Demand Gap

## Uber Supply-Demand Gap Analysis: Identifying Challenges & Proposing Solutions

### Introduction
This data science endeavor focuses on analyzing Uber's supply-demand gap, a critical concern 
impacting its service efficacy. The dataset chosen for this study provides deep insights through its six key columns.

#### Dataset Overview
- **Request.id**: A unique identifier for each request.
- **Pickup.point**: Location where the ride request was generated.
- **Driver.id**: Identifier for the driver assigned to the request.
- **Status**: Indicates the status of the request (e.g., completed, canceled).
- **Request.timestamp**: Time when the request was made.
- **Drop.timestamp**: Time when the request was completed.

### Data Cleaning and Manipulation
Before diving into the analysis, it's crucial to ensure the dataset's quality and integrity. We addressed the following:

#### Data Inconsistencies
- Converted the 'Request timestamp' from an object to a datetime format for ease of analysis.
- Ensured consistency in date separators by converting all "/" and "-" to a single format.

### Trends Analysis
Upon analysis, it was observed that the pattern of requests is quite interesting, with 
high volumes during morning and evening rush hours. A significant number of trips are 
being **canceled in the early morning** hours and a large number of **no cars available** during the evening rush hours.

### Time Binning
To better understand the flow of requests throughout the day, time was segmented into:
- **Pre_Morning**: 12 AM ‚Äì 5 AM
- **Morning_Rush**: 5 AM ‚Äì 10 AM
- **Day_Time**: 10 AM ‚Äì 5 PM
- **Evening_Rush**: 5 PM ‚Äì 10 PM


Post-segmentation, a clearer image of the supply-demand challenge emerged. Two bars, one green and one orange, 
were particularly prominent. These bars are indicative of the challenges faced during the Evening and Morning rush hours.

Looking at the status of the trips by pickup during the **morning rush** tells us the majority of **canceled** trips are from the city to the airport.

Looking at the status of the trips by pickup during the evening rush tells us the majority of no cars available are from the airport to the city.

Key trends observed from binning:
- Majority of **canceled** trips during the morning rush are from the city to the airport.
- Majority of **no cars available** during the evening rush are from the airport to the city.

### Key Findings
- High volume of morning requests from the city.
- High volume of evening requests from the airport.

### Problem Identification
- **Morning Rush**: 50% of city trips were canceled.
- **Evening Rush**: Car unavailability affected 70% of airport trips.

### üéØ Recommendations
#### Morning Rush Solutions
- **Incentivize Drivers**: Bonuses for each completed city-to-airport trip.
- **Gas Mileage Compensation**: Cover drivers' gas mileage for empty returns.
- **Boost Airport Demand**: Marketing efforts and price cuts for airport passengers.

#### Evening Rush Solutions
- **Driver Bonuses**: Incentives for airport trips during evening rush.
- **Compensate Empty Trips**: Pay drivers for passenger-less trips to the airport.
- **Ride Pooling**: Fewer cars serving more passengers, optimizing supply.
